    "My friend [Andrew Key] and I are developing a series of [Data Science Challenges] to help each other and others become better Data Scientists by working on hands-on projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains my work for the first challenge, _Exploring the Meetup API_ in my city of choice, beautiful **Vancouver, BC**.\n",

    "## Challenge 01: Explore the Meetup API\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [Meetup API] to explore meetups in your city of choice.\n",

    "**Guide Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some guide line questions to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the largest meetup in your location of choice (city, cities, country...etc)?\n",
    "- How many meetups of a certain category (e.g. Tech, Art...etc) are in your city?\n",
    "- Basic statistics of meetups\n",
    "    - What is the average size of meetups?\n",
    "    - How frequently do meetups host events?\n",
    "\n",
    "## My guideline\n",
    "\n",
    "I will focus on exploring the Tech Meetups in Vancouver. Specifically, I will look at the size and activity of these meetups.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I explore the data, I will also raise additional questions that could be further explored as extensions to this project.\n",
